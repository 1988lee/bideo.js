HTML5 Background Video
======================

Want to play a video in the background of a container or `body` itself ? This plugin will help you do exactly that. I'd suggest you to [read this article](http://codetheory.in/html5-fullscreen-background-video/) too.

[**Demo**](http://rishabhp.github.io/background-video/)

Features
--------

### Resizing

The `video` element in use will automatically adapt to the container's dimensions. It will also resize as the browser window resizes.

### Overlay

Plugin doesn't supports any overlay as it is easy to implement that with plain HTML/CSS in [your code](http://codetheory.in/html5-fullscreen-background-video/#overlays).

### Network Speed

For more information, read the explanation [here](http://codetheory.in/html5-fullscreen-background-video/#network_speed).

Options
-------

Check `main.js`.
